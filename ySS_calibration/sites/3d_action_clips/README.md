Using **naming sceem** of actions (clips) you can have access to them in **yss site**. This example is touching the surface but it can:

* play in loop defined clip

* seek

* manually force render (I don't want loop with infinite render. It render only on change!)

Slider are for debug only but if you feed it with:

**msg** type: json **example** 

```json
{ msg: "and/msg", payload: int }
```

**where int** - 0...100



or



**msg** type: json **example**

```json
{ msg: "and/heel", payload: int }
```

**where int** - 0...100
