# 3d action clips - test

Exploring / playground for threejs. This time playing with clips from *.gbl file to have animation defined in blender.

### for what it is?

Blender as a 3d program have lot grater tools to make seekwance of key fromes / animations with objects. If you use **Action Editor**. It's a future you can find it in Editor type

Using **naming sceem** of actions (clips) you can have access to them in **yss site**. This example is touching the surface but it can:

* play in loop defined clip

* actionSeek

* manually force render (I don't want loop with infinite render. It render only on change!)

* have **t4y.init_click()** use case so your object after click are sending click event to mqtt. *more options coming TODO*
  
  sending **msg**
  
  ```json
  { "topic": "sites/3d action clips/CubeR", "payload": "click" }
  ```
  
  Where 
  
  * *3d action clip* is comming from site nome
  
  * *CubeR* - object interaction



Sliders on site are for debug only but if you change it will emit:

**msg** type: json **example** 

```json
{ msg: "and/msg", payload: int }
```

**where int** - 0...100

or

**msg** type: json **example**

```json
{ msg: "and/heel", payload: int }
```

**where int** - 0...100
