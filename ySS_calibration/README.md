**yss** Is a set of helping functions and mechanisms to get a web browser page with menu, shaders, colors invert, red-black, rotation, ... It also provides a remote Screens Managment functionality (in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz_WaZtpGYo).

# What is in it ?

It gives you access to librarys: three.js, jquery, jquery mobile, d3.js, svg.js, websocket, rapheal, ml5, ..... It will be a base to start with your site for your need. It's now comming with some examples. But nothing is obligatory :) You can fill free to edit any section of the project and if you create something cool share with all of as!

# Intrudaction

**!! It's in progress !!** current version of yss in in a process of big transformation.

It is a part of a oiyshTerminal ecosystem. As a solution to have a alterative to node-dashboard ore other custom build web page this is providing you with set of helpers to make your page live fast !



---



# yss panel Prototype

Most basic page is ./s_blankPage.js

```javascript
class s_blankPage{

  get getName(){
    return "blank page";
  }

  getHtml(){
    return 'blank page';
  }

  getHtmlAfterLoad(){
    console.log("s_blankPage getHtmlAfterLoad()");
  }

  get svgDyno(){
    return s_fitscreen;
  }

  svgDynoAfterLoad(){}

  onMessageCallBack( r ){
    console.log("s_blankPage got msg ");
  }

}
```

You need to add your stuff in adequate sections. In future there will be a prototype to enheret from but for now it's like it's. Those are the functions / methodes as a minimum on site of your thing to make site working. 



---



# On top off .svg files

**examples:** ./s_testFunctsPage.js or ./s_basicSailPage.js

![yss basic sail page](https://github.com/yOyOeK1/oiyshTerminal/blob/main/ySS_calibration/screenShots/basicSailing_newMenu.png?raw=true)

This is a s_basicSailPage.js it is a .svg page example.



---



# On top off Three.js

**examples:** ./s_illoNav3D.js or ./s_3dCompass1.js

![yss iloo nav 3d page](https://github.com/yOyOeK1/oiyshTerminal/blob/main/ySS_calibration/screenShots/ilooNav3D_ver0.1.png?raw=true)

This is a s_threeTestPage.js it is a Three.js page example.

Main Atraction is handled by instance in "t4y" variable.



## Functions / methodes of t4y:

```javascript
t4y.getHtml();
```

Returns string getHtml data needed in getHtml() of your page.

```javascript
t4y.getHtmlAfterLoad( 's_ilooNav3D.glb',
  {
    'camPos': [0.028763731041237167, 103.44550962401865, -93.74328394639551],
    'camRot': [-1.909218085730232, -0.0015954765259057495, -0.0],
    'controls': false,
    'lightPos': [0,100,-190],
    'camDeb': false
  });
```

To getHtmlAfterLoad in page building step. To get working 3d model from file, 's_ilooNav3D.glb' and set some attributes.

```javascript
t4y.doAni( t4y.otsce.getObjectByName("Empty"), {
    'rotateY': 10
});
```

Will find object Empty and rotate by Y axis to angle deg 10. Do animation setup.

```javascript
t4y.putText( "heel: 11",{
    name :"HeelText",
    color: 0x000000,
    size: 6,
    replace: "HeelText",
    handle: 'cb',
    x:15,
    y: -5,
    z: -52,
    rx:90,
    extrude: .5
});
```

Replace text in current scean. Will look for HeelText to replace it with this one with name HeelText. handle: [cb|lb|lt|rt|rb] aligning.

# TODO

* 3d compass is super hi load on ecosia.
* three.js don't scale down frame when it's not in aspect. When it's to narrow it's bed.
* t4y need sequence loader to unify variables for async actions :/ or some callback system that it's ready after t4y.getHtmlAfterLoad();
* otdm-tools integration to make query about what is possible to use now.

# NOTES

* interesting stuff:
* three.js ray example to check intersection with objects. for selections?
  https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_interactive_cubes.html
* three.js physics example nice
  https://threejs.org/examples/?q=ammo#physics_ammo_cloth
* three.js TWEEN easing options and annimations improvment options

# CHANGELOG

230117

- mkShader from yss on the wallpaper / fixing it. Still some elements are not going over shader :/ iloonav and guages

yoyoek1

230116

- screen manager buttons finger size.
- shader buttons in side menu same size as screen manager magic character >>[â€Ž ]<< you can't see it but it's not a space :)
- menu shader icons visible what is on / off.
- yss svg shader same as three.js ...... red, invert is reacting same way as three.js so red invert work as toogle. but it revile pure implementation of svg shader :(

yoyoek1

230115

- there is now a console in canvas listining for keys. For now h or ? will show help. It can do some stuff.
- renderIt and myAnimation got some cainda a collecting system for requests if someone wants something to render or animate. Requests are put in setTimeout reseting old one in delay of ms to next render time. so max.
- fix orbital control. wow! WoW
- three.js update model light folows camera. Illusion of flash light. Autorotation of orbitalControl. :)
- fixed no animation render an animation after standby
- ml5.js disable by default.
- renderIt clears timeout.
- fixing missing files

yoyoek1

230114

- torking scrues on anti multi render request. to many renders !
- new fps limiter only on animation.
- three4jss now is only adding light if there is no light in scene file or you requestet for it. other way its no light.
- osd performance left me only with a task to fix mixers.

yoyoek1

230113

- osd performance tweaks, animations tweaks.
- fix glitching on resize
- I build a small benchmark flow to run 90 messages over instruments it's 2Hz update. It starts firefox run test, then spits out sys and user time :) So for Reference I'm addin benchTable
- degToHdg( deg ) Returns nice 000 format heading str.
- osd some optimalization for not rebuilding same value, camera position update.

yoyoek1

230112

- t4y.putText - osd in progress.. O it can do also :P fov of camera detection nice aligning cb|lt|rt|lb|rb ciach :) 19:03 :P
- t4y.getHtmlAfterLoad no more ott arg.
- Fixing subPixel section to update on resize screen. >600: 4; > 500: 2
- Fixing camera swaping system. When glb have "Camera" t4y is trying to swap to it. All is loaded async so there is a problem what is current in use. Shader done.
- spliting three4yss.js for more files. DONE: T4y_putText, T4y_shadersDefs, T4y_shader, T4y_ani

yoyoek1

2301111450

- Moving to directory per site structure.
- Adding libs directory to hold all libs not in main dir.
- Fixing new paths. Flow of ySS update to new paths :) system
- in t4y on load glb it check if there is no "Camera" coming from glb file. If is there should getting position from it. It's doing it but shader and orbit stopt work :(
